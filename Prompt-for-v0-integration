I have an existing Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS RepOrder dashboard application with the following structure:

**EXISTING CODEBASE:**
- Two dashboard interfaces: Company (/dashboard/company) and Rep (/dashboard/rep)
- React Query for data fetching
- Mock API endpoints at /api/dashboard/store-owner/me and /api/dashboard/rep/me
- Supabase integration setup in src/lib/supabaseAdmin.ts
- Database types in src/lib/database.types.ts
- Existing database schema for stores, products, permissions

**V0 DESIGN TO INTEGRATE:**
[UPLOADED FILES]

**INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:**
Please update my existing codebase to match this v0 design by:

1. **UI Components**: Replace existing components to match v0 styling exactly
2. **Database Integration**: If the v0 design shows new data fields (SKUs, product details, etc.), please:
   - Update Supabase schema/migrations as needed
   - Create proper database queries in API routes
   - Replace mock data with real Supabase queries
   - Update TypeScript types to match database schema
3. **API Evolution**: Convert mock endpoints to real Supabase-backed APIs when new data is needed
4. **Data Flow**: Ensure React Query works with real database queries
5. **Type Safety**: Update all TypeScript interfaces for database and component props

**SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:**
- If you see product SKUs, inventory levels, or detailed product data in v0 → assume this needs Supabase product tables
- If you see user permissions or role management → update the existing permission system
- If you see new data relationships → create appropriate foreign keys and joins
- Replace mock data progressively (keep mocks for features not yet in database)

**DATABASE ASSUMPTIONS:**
When v0 shows data that would logically come from a database:
- Create/update Supabase tables as needed
- Write proper SQL queries with joins
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Follow existing database patterns in the codebase

Please provide both UI updates AND database integration code.
